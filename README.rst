.openstack.org::

    pip install git+https://git.openstack.org/openstack/python-zaqarclient.git

What's in the box

How to use
==========

Python client
-------------

Details about design, features, usage and workflow can be found in the
`Python Client Wiki`_.

.. _Python Client Wiki: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Zaqar/PythonClient

Command line interface
----------------------

Zaqar bases its client implementation in the `OpenStack Client`_. It can be
installed and configured by following the instructions in *Getting Started*
and *Configuration* in the `OpenStack Client Readme`_ respectively.

The CLI currently allows creation, removal and listing of queues. Some examples
are::

    $  openstack queue list --limit 3
    $  openstack queue create myqueue
    $  openstack queue delete myqueue
